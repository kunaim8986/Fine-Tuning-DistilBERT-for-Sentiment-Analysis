Abstract

This ground-breaking research develops a fine-tuned â€“ Transformer for Sentiment Analysis (FT-TSA). 
Modern text data sentiment analysis is complicated, but this work takes a novel technique. 
The FT-TSA model is carefully built to capture sentiment nuances and adapt to changing language and environment. 
It achieves state-of-the-art sentiment classification using comprehensive data preparation, tokenization, and parameter tuning. 
FT-TSA outperforms traditional sentiment analysis models and generic Transformers in complex or context-dependent attitudes, 
according to empirical assessments on standard sentiment analysis datasets. We consider the implementation to pre-train 
a smaller general-purpose language representation model, DistilBERT, which can be fine-tuned to perform well on a wide 
range of tasks like its larger equivalents. This research shows FT-TSA's adaptability by applying it to sentiment-aware 
recommendation systems and social media sentiment tracking. In conclusion, this study introduces a novel and highly 
adaptable Transformer-based model that advances sentiment analysis and addresses the challenges of evolving sentiment 
expressions in modern text data.
